# Tasks - To Do

Demo video <https://youtu.be/ifq3oF9ktKA>

## Overview
I created this web app to help myself and others stay organized and quickly create and track their to-do tasks, such as making shopping lists or task lists, taking notes, record collecdtions, setting reminders and more to improve their productivity and focus on what matters the most.

## Files & Directories

This web app includes 1 app called **todo** with 2 folders and 3 pythons files (urls.py, views.py and models.py) which are utilized by Django to perform CRUD operations in the app.

1. todos - the main project directory 
   - settings.py - generated by Django; contains the INSTALLED_APPS of **todo**, and AUTH_USER_MODEL of **todo.User**
   - urls.py - contains the project urls.
  
2. todo - the app directory 
   - static/todo - folder that contains the script and css file for the **todo** app
        - styles.css - contains css rules to style the HTML elements of the app
        - index.js - contains the scripts to render data and perform CRUD functionality of the app.
   
   - templates/todo - folder that contains all the html templates to be rendered to the app users.
        - layout.html - base template for other templates
        - register.html - template for registering a new account
        - login.html - template for logging in the app
        - index.html - template for displaying nav bar, create a new task form, completed and pending tasks and footer template.
        - navbar.html - template for selecting different task lists; sorting the task lists by Importance, Due date, Alphabetically or Creation Date; and showing/hiding the New Task form
        - newtaskform.html - template for creating a new Task, contains the title, due date, reminder date and repeat options.
        - footer.html - a simple footer template.
    
    - views.py - contains the functions that fetch and filter data from the Task model and sort them per the user's request and send them to the frondend.
    
    - urls.py - contains the main urls that the user can visit to perform CRUD operations
    
    - models.py - contains 2 models:
        - User model which inherits the AbstractUser model
        - Task model which defines the title and other info related to the task to help the user create and track their tasks. It has a foreign relationship with the User model.

3. manage.py - generated by Django by default
4. db.sqlite3 - Django's default database containing the User and Task models.

## How to run the app

1. Install Python if not already done so.
2. Create a virtual environment inside project directory.
3. Install Django.
4. Run the command `python manage.py runserver` to start the app.
5. Sign up to create an account and log in to start creating and tracking your __Tasks - To Do__.
6. Click the `(⨁)` button on the top right corner to open the create new task menu where the user can enter the task title, due date, reminder date and repeat options of their choice -> click `Add` button to add the task to the list of __Tasks - To Do__.
7. Click the `(↑↓)` button to sort the tasks by __Importance__, __Due date__, __Aphabetically__ or __Creation date__ in ascending or descending order.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

I believe my project is sufficiently distinct from the other projects in this course and more complex for the following reasons:
- This is a single page app that 

This web app utilizes Django on the back-end and JavaScript on the front-end and enables users to quickly and conveniently create and track list of to-do tasks for themselves. The user-interface is very simple and easy-to-use and mobile-responsive and utilizes lots of Javascript features to make the user experience as smooth and convenient as possible. It's neither an e-commerce site nor a social network site nor a food-ordering app, therefore, it's very distinct from other projects used in this course.
