# Tasks - To Do

Demo video <https://youtu.be/ifq3oF9ktKA>

## Overview
I created this web app to help myself and others stay organized and quickly create and track their to-do tasks, such as making shopping lists or task lists, taking notes, record collectioins, setting reminders and more to improve their productivity and focus on what matters the most.

## Files & Directories
1. todos - the main project directory 
   - settings.py - generated by Django; contains the INSTALLED_APPS of **todo**, and AUTH_USER_MODEL of **todo.User**
   - urls.py - contains the project urls.
  
2. todo - the app directory
   
   - static/todo - folder that contains the script and css file for the **todo** app
        - styles.css - contains css rules to style the HTML elements of the app
        - index.js - contains the scripts to render data and perform CRUD functionality of the app.
   
   - templates/todo - folder that contains all the html templates to be rendered to the app users.
        - layout.html - base template for other templates
        - register.html - template for registering a new account
        - login.html - template for logging in the app
        - index.html - template for displaying nav bar, create a new task form, completed and pending tasks and footer template.
        - navbar.html - template for selecting different task lists; sorting the task lists by Importance, Due date, Alphabetically or Creation Date; and showing/hiding the New Task form
        - newtaskform.html - template for creating a new Task, contains the title, due date, reminder date and repeat options.
        - footer.html - a simple footer template.
    
    - views.py - contains the functions that fetch and filter data from the Task model and sort them per the user's request and send them to the frondend.
    
    - urls.py - contains the main urls that the user can visit to perform CRUD operations
    
    - models.py - contains 2 models:
        - User model which inherits the AbstractUser model
        - Task model which defines the title and other info related to the task to help the user create and track their tasks. It has a foreign relationship with the User model.
    - migrations - folder that was generated by Django upon creating the 2 above models, making migrations and migrating the models

3. manage.py - generated by Django by default
4. db.sqlite3 - Django's default database containing the User and Task models.

## How to run the app

1. Install Python if not already done so.
2. Create a virtual environment inside project directory.
3. Install Django.
4. Run the command `python manage.py runserver` to start the app.
5. Sign up to create an account and log in to start creating and tracking your __Tasks - To Do__.
6. Click the `(⨁)` button on the top right corner to open the create new task menu where the user can enter the task title, due date, reminder date and repeat options of their choice -> click `Add` button to add the task to the list of __Tasks - To Do__.
7. Click the `(↑↓)` button to sort the tasks by __Importance__, __Due date__, __Aphabetically__ or __Creation date__ in ascending or descending order.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

Though my project was inspired by the TODO List app presented in week 5 of the course (link here <https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/notes/5/#todo-list>),
I believe my project is sufficiently distinct from this project and more complex for the following reasons:
- My project utilized Django with 2 models on the back-end and JavaScript on the front-end for updating and displaying content, so the tasks are saved in the SQlite database, not local storage, so the data will not be lost when the page is refreshed.
- Users must log in to be able to create and track their own tasks.
- The users can easily sort tasks by Importance, Due date, Alphabetically or Creation Date in ascending or descending order without reloading the page.
- The users can seach for a specific task or mutiple tasks by its title by typing in the search box, and the app will automatically filter the task(s) as they are typing without reloading the page.
- The users can update the task details (title, due date, reminder date, repeat options) instantly wihout reloading the page.
- The users can toggle the Importance and Completion status of the task(s) and the other task lists will update instantly without reloading the entire page.
- My application is also mobile responsive. Please see the demo video in the link on the top of the page.
